# Welcome

SOMETHING is a token launchpad focused on the Linea ecosystem.

* **Community-native conversations** through inbuilt chat
* **Gamified engagement** with Karma Points (like Reddit XP)
* **Identity-building** through user profiles and follower mechanics
* **Social retention** via notification systems and activity-based visibility

All of this is layered atop a powerful token infrastructure with fair launches, locked liquidity, and creator-owned revenue. This documentation outlines WAGMIEâ€™s infrastructure, social layer, and token launch mechanics.

This documentation outlines how SOMETHING works, its key features, economic model, and the infrastructure behind the platform.
