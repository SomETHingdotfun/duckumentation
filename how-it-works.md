# How It Works?

**Something.fun** is designed to make launching and trading tokens effortless — while keeping things transparent and trust-less.

#### Fair Launch for Everyone

Every token on **Something.fun** follows a **fair-launch model**.\
There are **no pre-sales, no team allocations, and no hidden advantages** — just open access for everyone from the very first trade.

#### Launching Your Token

When you launch a token, it’s automatically paired with **$SMTH**, the core token of the ecosystem.\
From the moment trading begins, you’ll **earn 0.35% of all LP fees** generated through swaps on your pair.

#### Built-In Conversion Mechanism

Buyers can use a variety of supported coins to purchase your token.\
All non-$SMTH transactions are **automatically converted into $SMTH**, creating continuous **buy pressure for the $SMTH token**.\
When users sell, they receive **$SMTH** in return — keeping liquidity and value circulating within the ecosystem.

#### Growing Together

As **$SMTH** grows, every token paired with it benefits.\
This interconnected design means **creators and the community rise together**, building a network of projects that strengthen the entire ecosystem.

### Understanding the Launch Curve System

The launch curve system is the technological backbone that makes instant trading possible. When a token is created, the system automatically provisions initial liquidity through our supported DEXes.

The customisable tick ranges allow for precise control over price discovery, while graduation ticks enable a gradual price progression that can be tailored to the project's needs. This system automatically manages liquidity, ensuring stable trading conditions from the moment of launch.

### **Smart Liquidity Split**

* **80%** of the supply is placed in a trading range between **$5,000–$69,000** market cap. This means that the majority of liquidity is concentrated in the price band where early buyers are expected to trade, ensuring high availability and depth.
* **20%** is allocated from **$69,000 to infinity, allowing the token to scale upward naturally as demand grows.**

### **Liquidity Locking**

The entire liquidity is secured on **GoPlus SafeLocker**, removing any chance of a rug pull.\
