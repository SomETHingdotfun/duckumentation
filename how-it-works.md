# How It Works?

Creating a token on SOMETHING is a streamlined process that balances simplicity with powerful customization options. Users begin by providing basic token details such as name and symbol, then select their preferred funding token (like WETH or USDC).&#x20;

The platform then guides creators through the configuration of launch parameters, ensuring they understand the implications of each setting. After paying any applicable creation fees, the token is created and immediately available for trading, with initial liquidity already in place.

### Understanding the Launch Curve System

The launch curve system is the technological backbone that makes instant trading possible. When a token is created, the system automatically provisions initial liquidity through our supported DEXes.&#x20;

The customizable tick ranges allow for precise control over price discovery, while graduation ticks enable a gradual price progression that can be tailored to the project's needs. This system automatically manages liquidity, ensuring stable trading conditions from the moment of launch.

### **Smart Liquidity Split**

- **80%** of the supply is placed in a trading range between **$5,000â€“$69,000** market cap. This means that the majority of liquidity is concentrated in the price band where early buyers are expected to trade, ensuring high availability and depth.
- **20%** is allocated from **$69,000 to infinity, allowing the token to scale upward naturally as demand grows.**

### **Liquidity Locking**

The entire liquidity is secured on **GoPlus SafeLocker**, removing any chance of a rug pull.\
