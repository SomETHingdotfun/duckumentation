# Collecting Trading Fees

Something implements a streamlined fee claiming system that ensures fair distribution of trading fees among stakeholders. This document explains how the fee claiming process works, the role of NFTs in token launches, and how different entities participate in fee distribution.

## NFT Creation and Ownership

Every token launch on Something automatically creates an NFT that represents ownership and control over the launched token. This NFT serves several important purposes:

1. **Ownership Verification**: The NFT holder is recognized as the official owner of the launched token
2. **Fee Claiming Rights**: The NFT holder has the right to claim trading fees generated by the token
3. **Token Control**: The NFT holder can manage certain aspects of the token's parameters

The NFT is minted to the token creator's address during the launch process and can be transferred to other addresses if ownership needs to be changed.

### Trading Fee Structure

On Linea, Something charges a flat 1% trading fee on all trades. This fee is automatically collected and distributed among different parties as follows:

* **Referral**: 0.15%
* **Treasury**: 0.15%
* **Token Creator**: 0.35%
* **Redacted**: 0.35%

This structure ensures that both the protocol and token creators benefit fairly from trading activity, while also supporting referrals and Consensys as an infrastructure provider.
