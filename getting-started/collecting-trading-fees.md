# Liquidity Pool Fees

The **Something Launchpad** applies a **1% fee** on all liquidity pool transactions.\
This model ensures sustainable growth for the platform while rewarding the community and supporting developers launching new tokens.\
Each portion of this fee serves a distinct purpose, aligning incentives across users, creators, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.

## Referral (0.15%)&#x20;

* If no referral code is used—or if referral fees remain unclaimed—they are held in the **Referral Fee Wallet**.

* These funds may also be **reallocated** toward future **community rewards** or **incentive programs** as needed.

## Treasury (0.15%)

* Sent directly to the **Launchpad Treasury**.
* Supports **operational costs**, **ecosystem expansion**, and **ongoing platform development**.

## Token Creator (0.35%)
