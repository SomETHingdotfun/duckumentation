# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Notice explains how SOMETHING (“SOMETHING”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal information when you access or use our website, platform, tools, and related services (collectively, the “SOMETHING Platform” or “Services”).

By using the SOMETHING Platform, you consent to the practices outlined in this Notice. If you do not agree with any part of it, we kindly ask that you discontinue use of the SOMETHING Platform.

We may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes in law, technology, or our operations. You are encouraged to review it periodically. If any material changes are made, we will notify users accordingly.

## Applicability

This Privacy Notice applies to all users of the SOMETHING Platform, including creators, traders, referrers, and site visitors. Our services are intended for individuals aged 18 and above.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe a child has submitted data to us, please notify us so we can take appropriate action and delete the information.

## Data Controller

SOMETHING acts as the data controller for your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The term “Personal Data” refers to any information that can directly or indirectly identify you as an individual. This does not include anonymized or aggregated data that cannot be linked back to an individual.

## What We Collect

We collect personal data both directly from you and automatically through your interaction with the SOMETHING Platform. Information you may provide includes wallet addresses, social media profiles for creator verification (if you opt in), details about your project if you choose to launch tokens, and referral codes if you participate in our referral program.

Information collected automatically includes IP address, browser and device data, operating system version, referral source, usage activity such as page visits or interaction logs, and geolocation data where permitted.

We also use cookies and similar technologies to facilitate session management, performance tracking, referral attribution, and dashboard functionality.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Cookies are small files used to remember information about your visit. We use cookies to maintain user sessions, store platform preferences, analyze traffic, and enable key features like creator dashboards and referral systems. You can manage cookie preferences via your browser settings, although restricting cookies may reduce your user experience. For more information about cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

## Use of Personal Data

Your personal data is used to operate and enhance the SOMETHING Platform. This includes enabling features such as token launches, creator verification, and referral tracking.

It also allows us to provide user support, analyze engagement, and improve the overall design and functionality of our services.

Additionally, we use personal data to promote community engagement through rewards and referrals, detect and prevent abuse (such as bot activity or fraud), and to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, including anti-money laundering requirements.

## Data Sharing and Transfers

Your data may be shared with third-party service providers that help us maintain the SOMETHING Platform, including infrastructure providers, analytics services, exchange listing partners, and identity verification services.

Where relevant, your data may be visible to other users. For instance, through onchain token activity or public creator profiles.

We do not sell your personal data. If we undergo a business transaction such as a merger or acquisition, your data may be transferred accordingly. If data is transferred across borders, we ensure appropriate safeguards in compliance with international data protection standards.

## Blockchain Activity

The SOMETHING Platform includes features that are integrated with public blockchain networks like Solana. Actions such as token launches, trades, referrals, and reward claims may be permanently recorded on these decentralized ledgers.

As SOMETHING has no control over blockchain infrastructure, we cannot modify or erase data once it has been written on-chain. Such records may be linked to your wallet address and potentially to your identity if you have shared it elsewhere. We encourage users to interact with on-chain systems with awareness and discretion.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. This may include the period during which you remain an active user, as well as any time required to meet legal, tax, or compliance obligations. Once your data is no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize it unless a longer retention period is mandated by law.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights with regard to your personal data. These include the right to access, correct, or delete your data; withdraw consent where applicable; object to or restrict certain processing; and request a portable copy of your data. You may also have the right to file a complaint with your local data protection authority. To exercise these rights, please contact our support team with sufficient details for us to verify your identity and process your request.

## Security

We implement technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal data. This includes encryption, access controls, internal audits, and secure infrastructure. However, no platform, especially one that integrates with public blockchain systems is completely immune to risk.

We strongly encourage you to protect your wallet credentials, monitor your activity, and use secure devices when interacting with the SOMETHING Platform.
