# Collecting Trading Fees

SOMETHING implements a sophisticated fee claiming system that ensures fair distribution of trading fees among various stakeholders. This document explains how the fee claiming process works, the role of NFTs in token launches, and how different entities participate in fee distribution.

## NFT Creation and Ownership

Every token launch on SOMETHING automatically creates an NFT that represents ownership and control over the launched token. This NFT serves several important purposes:

1. **Ownership Verification**: The NFT holder is recognized as the official owner of the launched token
2. **Fee Claiming Rights**: The NFT holder has the right to claim trading fees generated by the token
3. **Token Control**: The NFT holder can manage certain aspects of the token's parameters

The NFT is minted to the token creator's address during the launch process and can be transferred to other addresses if ownership needs to be changed.

## 3rd Party Protocol Fees

Note that each of the underlying protocols that SOMETHING uses also charge their own fees. This fee is unavoidable and even applies to [premium tokens](premium-tokens/).&#x20;

### Etherex Integration

- **Standard fee:** 1% of all trades
- **Fee collection:** Automatic through the Etherex protocol
- **Distribution**: Direct to Etherex treasury

### GoPlus Locker Integration

- **Standard fee:** 2.8% of all trades
- **Purpose**: Security and locker services
- **Distribution**: Automatic to GoPlus protocol
- **Info**: [https://docs.gopluslabs.io/page/goplus-safetoken-locker](https://docs.gopluslabs.io/page/goplus-safetoken-locker)

Taking into the protocol fees, if a token is a standard token, creators can claim upto 57% of all trading fees generated and if a token is a premium token, then creators can claim upto 97% of all trading fees.
